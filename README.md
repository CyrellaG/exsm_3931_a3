## The Story
“I am an investor looking to hire an engineer to turn my idea into reality... I picture a machine which contains snack sized chips and candy packs. If a hungry customer arrives and sees a snack that they like, they can simply put coins into the machine, enter the code of the snack they desire, and the machine will give them the snack they chose along with any change that may be owed to them. For myself, as the owner, I would need to unlock the machine with a key to regularly check the machine to make sure that I have enough snacks for sale, and to empty out the coin storage within the machine. Every time I check the machine, I presume that something has been sold, so I would need to restock the machine.”
